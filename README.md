<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The project called `IT Helpdesk System` is an software engineering project which aims to automate the process of asking customers questions and answering them within the shortest possible time through this software. The software should provide an interactive user interface along with a database for storing data. Users should also have different access to the system based on the privileges they possess in order to meet the needs of both the administrative side and the users. So the purpose of this software is to provide quality, secure, and sophisticated service to companies's equipment. In this software engineering project you can see different roles which are “Super Admin”, “System User”, “Client” and “Users”.

This project started from scratch where I worked and completed, also I made some improvements in the Software Engineering, such as creating the Use Case Diagram for entire system, creating the Use Case Description by explaining the use cases in more details, creating of the Class Diagram for use cases, creating of the Activity Diagrams for flow system, creating of the Sequence Diagrams for use cases, creating of the State Diagrams, creating of the CRUDE Analysis (CRUDE Matrix) table, creating of the Visual Presentation (GUI) for software system and many more things.


### Built With

This software engineering project is based on technologies like below:

* Enterprise Architect
* Adobe XD
* Microsoft Word
* Microsoft Excel


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

By getting started with the project, first you need to take a look at the required `Prerequisites` and after that the `Installation` steps.


### Prerequisites

In order to open this software project is required to have an Visual Modeling and Design Tool (Enterprise Architect), an UI/UX Design Tool (Adobe XD) and an Office Pack (Microsoft Word & Microsoft Excel).


### Installation
